# sparklines
Sparklines and Whisker Sparklines for Swift

A complete rewrite of [Andy Belsey's](https://github.com/abelsey/Sparklines) objective-c implementation of sparklines with the addition of whisker sparklines.

See [Tufte](http://www.edwardtufte.com/bboard/q-and-a-fetch-msg?msg_id=0001OR)

So far, the only documentation is the sample app.

The only scheme the sample app display has been tested on is a landscape 6s Plus.
